This 4 day summer camp for students ages 9-13 provides a hands on approach to learning how to design, build, and program Lego Mindstorm EV3 robots.

Each student will be introduced to basic concepts of how the robot can be built to solve simple problems using motors and sensors.  At several points during the program the students will have opportunities for mini-challenges where they will take what they have learned and put it into practice.  Each lesson is designed to slowy build upon what they have learned and culminate into a final working robot that they will compete with.

Beyond the mechanical aspects of building the robot, students will learn how to use the software that is used to program the robot's functions.
