Because we are a registered nonprofit, we rely heavily on company sponsorships, grants, and donations to support us. Without sponsors, what we do would not be improbable; it would be impossible, and we are extremely grateful for all of our sponsors! Below is a list of our current sponsors:

*The Optimist Club of Raleigh*

*Duke Energy*

*IBM*

*Terracon*

*NASA*

*Nutanix*

*Sellware*

*Athens Drive High School*
