This second week of build season, we continued to improve our shooter and started figuring out the different angles for shooting. We also continued designing our robot in CAD and figuring out the dimensions and angles for the different parts and fitting them all together. Towards the end of the week, we had many parts in the process of being built.  

Apart from the robot side of things, our team also started working on the marketing and business-related items, such as writing the Chairman’s essay and drawing t-shirt designs.

At the end of the week, our progress was delayed for about three days when a small ice storm hit the area. While we couldn’t work on the robot over that time, we were still able to work a lot on our t-shirt designs and essays. Overall, we were able to get a lot done this week despite a couple of challenges.
