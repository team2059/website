On the third week of build season, we started to work on finishing the shooter frame and cut pieces for the robot chassis. At the beginning of the week, our team had a more finalized design of the robot and started to work on building the chassis and fabricating different parts. We tweaked the shooter a little bit from the previous design we had to provide more movement for the joints. One of the more common points of the week was to have people crowding around a computer screen looking at the robot model in CAD (Computer-Aided Design). Starting to build the chassis was fun and it presented many tasks that could be done at once, which gave every member an opportunity to be even more involved with the production of the robot.  

On the business side of things, we progressed forward with the writing of the Chairmanâ€™s and Woodie Flowers award submissions. We also voted upon a t-shirt design and started to draw it in illustrator.
