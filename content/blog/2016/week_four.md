This past week, we continued to cut pieces for the chassis and assembled them. Along the way, we encountered a few problems such as cutting parts the wrong size and not making certain parts completely identical. This set us back a bit, but we were able to get everything cut correctly and assembled a little while later. While the chassis was getting built, our programming team was able to get the electronics wired and working. Additionally, they were able to program the basic robot functions: driving, shooting, and lifting. 

With our business group, we finished writing both the Chairman’s and Woodie Flowers essay submissions and successfully submitted both by the deadline. We also continued to design our t-shirts and buttons. 

While we had a few setbacks this week, we were still able to make a lot of progress on with our robot. Through our mistakes, members have been able to learn several valuable lessons, including, “Measure twice, cut once!”
