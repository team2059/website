This week, our team accomplished a lot to get the robot driving and the arm to aim for the high goal. We we were also able to get our shooter rollers working. Towards the end of the week, we started to work on building a second robot chassis to give ourselves something to practice with for the weeks in between bag and tag day and our first competition. 

While our build team was working on finishing building the robot, our marketing team was working on putting the final touches to the t-shirt design. 

Towards the end of the week, despite our busy schedule, we were still able to make it to Apex Elementary annual “Science Spectacular” event. Presenting to each grade level throughout the day, we were able to introduce hundreds of students to FIRST and the importance of STEM.
