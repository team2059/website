Our first event was a huge learning experience and helped us to develop a clearer, more focused game strategy. At the first event, we learned that shooting was not the way to go for us. As a result, we took off our shooter and ball collector. We also realized that while our gear collector was good, we could make it better and faster for our next events. In the few days leading up to the Greensboro District Event, we decided to make a second gear collector that could pick up gears off the floor and was automated. This, we discovered, would make our cycle time faster and ensure that the gear was placed on the airship more securely.

On Friday, we again started off a little rough due to having a new gear collector and being unable to make it to a practice round for more practice with it. After a few rounds, however, it was pretty obvious that our new gear collector was working well. It was common to score three to four gears in a match. Once again, we showed that we could climb and do gears well. At the end of the day, we were ranked in 8th place.

On Saturday, our team continued to improve and climb in the rankings. Our final ranking was 6th place overall in the competition. During alliance selections, the fourth highest ranking team chose us as their first pick. Our alliance ended up consisting of Team 900, The Zebracorns; Team 3331, Tarheel Robots; and Team 2059, The Hitchhikers. Though our alliance did not advance beyond quarterfinals, again the result of our alliance having some tech problems, we had a great time and continued to learn valuable lessons! It also helped that we were awarded the Gracious Professionalism Award again!!
