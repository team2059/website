A couple of weeks before Christmas, we participated in the Cary Christmas Parade for our third time, allowing us to showcase our robots and introduce our team to our community. To get ready for the parade, we all pitched in to decorate our robots and float with a ton of orange, blue, and holiday cheer. 

During the parade, we had Ford, Benjy, and Trillian shooting balls and frisbees. While some of our students stayed on the float to control the robots, others walked the course, catching the flying objects from the robots and handing out candy. As with previous years, having our robots launch frisbees and balls through the air never ceased to amaze the thousands of kids and parents.

Overall, the team had a blast, and a lot of people told us that they were super impressed with our demonstration! This yearâ€™s Cary Christmas Parade was another enjoyable experience, and we had a ton of fun supporting and spreading FIRST and sharing our enthusiasm for STEM!
