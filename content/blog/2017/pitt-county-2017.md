After bag & tag, we had about a week to prepare for our first competition, the Pitt County District Event. Over that week, we met on several days to continue fine tuning Slartibartfast, make buttons, start packing, and do anything else that needed to be done before competition.

On Saturday, we started off a little rough as our drive team was still getting used to the game and driving our robot, Slartibartfast. We had shown that we could do gears, but had not shown that we could climb. As the morning progressed, we got better and better. We showed that we had a consistent, fast climb and could deliver two to three gears in a match, which was very important in this game. At the end of the day, we were ranked in 2nd place.

The following day, we continued to improve and stayed steady in the rankings. Our final ranking was 2nd place overall in the competition. By the end of alliance selections, we had Team 4561, TerrorBytes, and Team 5607, Team Firewall as our alliance partners. While our alliance did not make it beyond quarterfinals, the result of our alliance having some tech problems, we had a blast and learned a lot! We also ended up getting the Gracious Professionalism Award for the sixth time!!
