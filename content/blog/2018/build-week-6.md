Week 6 was spent getting everything ready before for the end of build season. During this week, our main goals were to rebuild our carriage, which broke at the end of Week 5 during testing, and spend time calibrating our code. Thankfully, none of our leads got sick during this week, so things ran a little smoother!

This time around, we were able to rebuild our carriage with the design changes in three days! While it was not enjoyable and did nothing good for our health to have our carriage break at the end of Week 5, in the end, our carriage ended up better than it was! Needless to say, we are extremely happy (and relieved) about that!

On the day of Bag and Tag, we were able to meet at one of our student's church. The room they lent to us gave us much more space to actually test our robot. Finally, we were finished with testing and our 2018 robot, Grunthos, was bagged and tagged!

Now we are powering up for our first competition at the Pitt County District Event on March 9-11!
