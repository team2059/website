Week 4 was quite a blast of progress. Our Mechanical Team finished attaching our lifting mechanism and the battery holder to our chassis and have begun to build a few things for the mechanism we are using for manipulating the cargo and hatches. On our Programming Team, they worked on fine-tuning our vision system and are currently waiting to test their code.

As usual, our Business and Marketing Teams were very productive this week. Near the beginning of the week, the Chairmanâ€™s write-up was finished and the designs for the back of the shirt, cart panels, and the banners were completed. The front design of the shirt are in its final stages, and the fridge magnets are almost done. This week, they also started to work on the mice we hand out at competitions. Additionally, our raffle fundraiser is almost over, and we expect to raise a decent amount through the fundraiser, so we are quite pleased!

This week was also special because one of our alum came to visit us! This gave us a pleasant opportunity to sit down and catch up with a nice cup of tea.
