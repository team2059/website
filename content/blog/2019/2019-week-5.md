One of our main focuses of Week 5 was to finish fabricating our lift mechanism. Mechanically, we were able to accomplish that goal and more! Our endgame mechanism is mostly finished and mounted to our 2019 robot, and our collector for the hatches and cargo was worked on more. We have also finished the electrical layout and wiring.

For business and marketing, we completed quite a few things! All the magnets and mice have been made, the Woodie Flowers write-up submitted, and after some last touch-ups, the team shirt design got finalized. We then started to work on printing out our new pit banners and robot side cart panels and began the design process for the light-up cubes we have on the robot cart.
