We are *FIRST* Robotics Competition Team 2059, The Hitchhikers, with members
from Cary, Raleigh, Apex and across Wake County, North Carolina. Since 2010, we
have worked to build a stronger future through student leadership, impactful
community outreach, and a successful robotics program.

What is *FIRST*?
----------------

The  <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition (FRC) is a unique varsity sport of the mind
designed to help high-school-aged young people discover how interesting and
rewarding the life of engineers and researchers can be.
